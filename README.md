## 🚀 Installation

To install `React File Manager`, use the following command:

```bash
npm i @cubone/react-file-manager
```

## 💻 Usage

Here’s a basic example of how to use the File Manager Component in your React application:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { FileManager } from "@cubone/react-file-manager";
import "@cubone/react-file-manager/dist/style.css";

function App() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState([
    {
      name: "Documents",
      isDirectory: true, // Folder
      path: "/Documents", // Located in Root directory
      updatedAt: "2024-09-09T10:30:00Z", // Last updated time
    },
    {
      name: "Pictures",
      isDirectory: true,
      path: "/Pictures", // Located in Root directory as well
      updatedAt: "2024-09-09T11:00:00Z",
    },
    {
      name: "Pic.png",
      isDirectory: false, // File
      path: "/Pictures/Pic.png", // Located inside the "Pictures" folder
      updatedAt: "2024-09-08T16:45:00Z",
      size: 2048, // File size in bytes (example: 2 KB)
    },
  ]);

  return (
    <>
      <FileManager files={files} />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## 📂 File Structure

The `files` prop accepts an array of objects, where each object represents a file or folder. You can
customize the structure to meet your application needs. Each file or folder object follows the
structure detailed below:

```typescript
type File = {
  name: string;
  isDirectory: boolean;
  path: string;
  updatedAt?: string; // Optional: Last update timestamp in ISO 8601 format
  size?: number; // Optional: File size in bytes (only applicable for files)
};
```

## Action properties

| Property       | Type        | Description                                                                                                             |
|---------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **title**     | `string`    | Display name of the action (e.g., "Rename", "Delete", "Download").                                                    |
| **key**       | `string`    | Unique identifier for the action (e.g., "rename", "delete", "download").                                              |
| **onClick**   | `Function`  | Function executed when the action is triggered, receiving selected item/items as an argument.                                |
| **showToolbar** | `boolean`  | Determines if the action appears in the toolbar (`true` = visible, `false` = hidden).                                  |
| **showMenu**  | `boolean`   | Determines if the action appears in the context menu (`true` = visible, `false` = hidden).                             |
| **multiple**  | `boolean`   | Defines if the action supports multiple selections (`true` = supports multiple items, `false` = single selection only). |
| **applyTo** (TBD)   | `string[]` \| `undefined` | Specifies applicable file types (e.g., folder, pdf, mp4). If undefined, the action applies to all types. |
| **icon**      | `ReactNode`    | Defines the icon associated with the action (e.g., "mdi-delete").                                                       |
| **hidden**    | `boolean`   | Controls whether the action is hidden from the UI (`true` = hidden, `false` = visible).                                 |


## Example Usage

```JSX
<FileManager
    config={{
        actions: [
          {
            title: "Open",
            key: "open",
            onClick: handleFileOpen,
            showToolbar: false,
            showMenu: true,
          },
          {
            title: "Copy",
            key: "copy",
            onClick: handleCopy,
            showToolbar: true,
            showMenu: true,
          },
          {
            title: "Custom Action",
            key: "custom-action",
            onClick: handleCustomAction,
            showToolbar: true,
            showMenu: false,
            multiple: false,
            applyTo: [''],
            icon: <FaRegUser size={18} />,
            hidden: false
          },
        ],
    }}
    {...}
  />
```

## Notes

- `title` property might be handy to maintain internationalization(i18n).
- `applyTo` helps limit actions to **specific file types**, ensuring they are only displayed where applicable.
- `hidden: true` can be useful for **conditionally displaying actions** based on user roles, permissions, or UI state.

## Custom File Preview

The `FileManager` component allows you to provide a custom file preview by passing the
`filePreviewComponent` prop. This is an optional callback function that receives the selected file
as an argument and must return a valid React node, JSX element, or HTML.

### Usage Example

```jsx
const CustomImagePreviewer = ({ file }) => {
  return <img src={`${file.path}`} alt={file.name} />;
};

<FileManager
  // Other props...
  filePreviewComponent={(file) => <CustomImagePreviewer file={file} />}
/>;
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.

3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/branch-name`).
6. Open a Pull Request.

Get started by running following commands:

git clone https://github.com/Saifullah-dev/react-file-manager.git
cd react-file-manager
```

**Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

**Backend**

```bash
cd backend
npm i
npm run devStart
```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`, have fun!

**Database** <br> The application uses MongoDB to store file system changes (folders and images).

1. Install MongoDB if not already installed.
2. Ensure MongoDB service is running (default port: 27017).
3. Create a database named `fileManagerDB` (or as specified in `backend/.env`).

Check `backend/.env.example` for database configuration details.

> Note: `backend` here is just an example implementation of react-file-manager into your
> application. You may use any database and server combination of your choice.
